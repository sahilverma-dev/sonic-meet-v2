# Sonic Meet V2

Welcome to the Sonic Meet V2 repository! 🚀

## What's This?

About a year ago, I created Sonic Meet as a group video chat web application for a college project. Back then, my React and development skills were just starting to take shape, and I'll be honest—I made some mistakes and took a few shortcuts. Still, I was proud of what I achieved.

Now, fueled by a passion for learning, I'm diving into advanced concepts like WebRTC and sockets to enhance Sonic Meet for its V2 version. This project isn't just about adding new features; it's a journey of acknowledging past shortcomings and using them as stepping stones for personal and professional growth.

## What's the Plan?

This repository is currently a blank canvas. I'll be updating it as I make progress on Sonic Meet V2. Expect regular updates to this README.md where I'll share my development plan, insights, and experiences. Stay tuned for a detailed roadmap!
