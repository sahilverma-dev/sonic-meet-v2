# Sonic Meet V2

Welcome to the Sonic Meet V2 repository! 🚀

## Small Description

Sonic Meet is a group video chat web application that facilitates seamless communication and collaboration. This project is built using the following technologies:

## What's This?

About a year ago, I created Sonic Meet as a group video chat web application for a college project. Back then, my React and development skills were just starting to take shape, and I'll be honest—I made some mistakes and took a few shortcuts. Still, I was proud of what I achieved.

Now, fueled by a passion for learning, I'm diving into advanced concepts like WebRTC and sockets to enhance Sonic Meet for its V2 version. This project isn't just about adding new features; it's a journey of acknowledging past shortcomings and using them as stepping stones for personal and professional growth.

- Next JS for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn for components
- Clerk for authentication
- MySQL for database
- Drizzle ORM
- Socket.io to share ICE candidates
- WebRTC to share media streams
- Framer Motion for minimal animations (subject to change)
- Sonner for toasts (subject to change)

## Current Requirements

- User authentication and store in the database.
- Only authenticated users can create rooms for meetings.
- Only authenticated users can join the meet.
- Participated users can toggle on/off their audio and video streams and can also share their screen.
- In-meet text chat between participants.
- Notify everyone when a new user joins and leave the meeting with a toast.
- Users can leave the meeting, and if there’s no one left, remove the room.
